Energy-Mavericks Nexus HACKATHON project

## Project Overview
Generation of Electrical power using a water wheel. Giving an optimum performance by choosing the most effective components and circuitry for the school's load. Integration of the school's database in order to schedule time of turning on the gen based on school timetable.

##Problem Statement
The Lagos State University, particularly the Epe campus, is facing a severe shortage of electricity. This issue affects both students and staff, hindering academic activities such as laboratory work and practical exercises. The lack of power also leads to water scarcity, limited access to technology, and increased living costs for students. The inadequate electricity supply lasts for only about 3 hours per day, with the national electric supply offering light for an average of 2 days a week, lasting about 2-5 hours.

##Solution Approach
###Hardware:
The utilization of water flow to generate electricity through a water wheel is a traditional yet highly effective method. It involves harnessing the kinetic energy of a flowing water to rotate a wheel, which in turn powers an electrical generator through mechanical transmission units.
A water wheel, also known as a hydro power wheel or water turbine, is a device designed to convert the energy of flowing water into mechanical energy. It typically consists of a large wheel with blades attached around itâ€™s circumference. When water flows over or under the wheel, it rotates thereby converting the kinetic energy of the water into rotational energy.
###Software:
This project can greatly improve efficiency by directing the power generated by the water wheel to only those rooms and facilities that require electricity at a given time. This will ensure that electricity is always available where it is needed for practical exercises and other essential activities. The system will use data to analyze how and when the power is used. This will help us make adjustments and further improve efficiency in the future.



##Technologies Used 
1. Node.js
Role: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine.
Purpose: Enables server-side scripting, allowing me to build scalable network applications and handle multiple connections simultaneously.
2. Express.js
Role: A web application framework for Node.js.
Purpose: Simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs by providing robust features like routing, middleware support, and request/response handling.
3. HTML/CSS
Role: Core technologies for building web pages.
Purpose: HTML structures the content of my web application, while CSS is used for styling and layout. This combination ensures that my application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
4. JavaScript
Role: The primary programming language for web development.
Purpose: Used on the client-side for dynamic content and interaction, as well as on the server-side (via Node.js) for backend logic. It allows me to handle events, make API calls, and manipulate the DOM.
5. Body-Parser
Role: A middleware for Express.
Purpose: Parses incoming request bodies in a middleware, making it easier to handle JSON data from client requests.
6. Mock Database
Role: Simulated data storage.
Purpose: Used for testing and development, allowing me to define teacher data and their courses directly within my application without needing a separate database setup.
7. Deployment Platforms (e.g., Heroku)
Role: Cloud service for hosting applications.
Purpose: Provide an easy way to deploy your web application, making it accessible via a public URL. It manages scaling, uptime, and server maintenance, allowing me to focus on development.

##Detailed instruction on how to run the code locally
Open the app.js file using nodejs to run it on your local terminal.
cd to the teacher-app/ by typing "cd teacher-app" and run the app by typing "node app.js" in the terminal
On the landing page, fill in the teacher's or instructor's sign in details i.e Username, password, Accesskey.

Use the following details to sign in:
Username: Adedoyin Mary, Eng Folorunsho, Dr. Adedeji, Prof. Oyedeko, Engr Joseph
Password: adedoyin310, folorunsho210, adedeji212, oyedeko101, joseph592
Accesskey: 2801, 2207, 1101, 3501, 3801

You would be taken to another page, and there for the teacher's authority, you can turn on the power supply for the hall venue or practical lab to be used.
Remember to turn off the power supply when done.



##Future Development Plan
In the future, I plan to develop a software system that will use real-time data to optimize the operation of our water wheel hydropower electricity generation. This software will monitor the water flow, turbine speed, and power output in order to make adjustments that maximize efficiency and output. 
Additionally, the software could incorporate predictive analytics to anticipate maintenance needs and minimize downtime. This will ensure that the hydropower system operates at peak performance and provides a reliable source of electricity. 
The system will also use databases to check on which hostels are on internships (i.e., 400 level students) and prevent power from being wasted in their apartments. (Technology stack: MySQL and python)
